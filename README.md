## MVVM with clean architecture approach  
An Android project with MVVM pattern adapts which newest Android libraries: [Data binding](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/), [Lifecycle-Aware](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/lifecycle), [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/data-binding/), [LiveData](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/livedata), [Navigation](https://developer.android.com/guide/navigation/), [Paging](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/paging/), [Room](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/room), [ViewModel](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/viewmodel), [WorkManager](https://developer.android.com/topic/libraries/architecture/workmanager).   
And some another: [Koin](https://insert-koin.io/) + [Scope](https://insert-koin.io/docs/2.0/getting-started/android-scope/) use for dependency injection, handle synchronization by [RxJava 2](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxJava) + [RxAndroid](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxAndroid),  communication with api via [Retrofit](https://github.com/square/retrofit).

I also have created rx wrapper: detect location,  google sign in, facebook login, RxErrorHandlingCallAdapterFactory,... git clone and enjoy :)

## How to build?
Need to create secret-keys.gradle file (contain key of Google sign and Facebook) and add to root level project

    ext.GOOGLE_SIGN_IN_CLIENT_ID = "\"Your google sign in client id here\""
    ext.FACEBOOK_APP_ID = "\"Your facebook app id\""
    ext.FB_LOGIN_PROTOCOL_SCHEME = "\"Your fb login protocol scheme here\""

   - Google sing in id: https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/android/start
   - Facebook app id: https://developers.facebook.com/docs/facebook-login/android/

*If you don't want to run login function just comment out.*
